Project Warehouse Inventory: implement a program which can be used to manage
product in warehouse 
The program reads data from a file and imports those data to a dictionary.
There are few actions that user can interact with product in the program:
display all product's info, display specific product, 
change the stock of product, delete a product, inform user about low stock,
combine two product together, and set sale price for categories.
